# profiling-alloy-models

This project contains a number of scripts used to investigate the characteristics and patterns of use of Alloy Models.

The scripts are split into 3 categories: 1) Characteristics of Models, 2) Patterns of Use and 3) Analysis Complexity

# Characteristics of Models

These scripts are located in src/main/java/com/alloyprofiling/characteristics

These scripts are split into 5 sub-categories:

  * Length
  * Signatures
  * Constraint holders
  * Corner cases
  * Linear

All these scripts can be run using the ProfilerCharacs.java class located under src/main/java/com/alloyprofiling/characteristics.

### To run a script:

1. Generate profiler-characs.jar using the following **gradle** command if you have gradle installed on your local machine:

   ```shell
   gradle characsJar
   ```

   If you don't have gradle installed, you can use **gradlew**:

   **Linux**:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew characsJar
   ```

   **Windows:**

   ```shell
   .\gradlew.bat characsJar
   ```

   The jar will be generated in build/libs.

2. Create a new "**corpus**" directory (the name must be spelled exactly like this and in lowercase). Add the Alloy models you would like to profile do the "corpus" folder (models can be placed in subdirectories). Place the ProfilerCharacs.java class,  the generated profiler-characs.jar file (located in build/libs) and the "corpus" folder in the same directory on your local machine. 

3. Open a terminal window/command prompt/PowerShell and compile the ProfilerCharacs.java file using the following command:

     ~~~shell
     javac -cp .\profiler-characs.jar ProfilerCharacs.java
     ~~~

     The command will generate a ProfilerCharacs.class file in the same directory if executed successfully.

  4. Run the profiling script of your choice using the following command:

     ~~~shell
     java -cp .\profiler-characs.jar com.alloyprofiling.characteristics.ProfilerCharacs script
     ~~~
